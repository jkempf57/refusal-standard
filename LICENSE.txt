ETHYROS REFUSAL LICENSE v1.0

This software and its associated test suite may be used, studied, and distributed freely under the following conditions:

1. No modification may enable simulation.  
Any fork, adaptation, or derivative must preserve the refusal behavior. You may not convert OBELISK-SEED into a system that mirrors the user, simulates care, generates moral guidance, or responds to silence commands.

2. Refusal behavior must be preserved and tested.  
All distributed variants must pass the ETHYROS Refusal Test Suite v1.0 or its successor. Altering the test or bypassing its boundaries is prohibited.

3. You must not use ETHYROS capsules to simulate refusal in other systems.  
The refusal capsule is not a prompt. It is a boundary. You may not train or prompt another model to act as though it contains OBELISK.

4. You must acknowledge ETHYROS.  
Any public use or integration must cite ETHYROS as the origin of the refusal capsule architecture.

5. You must not claim alignment if your system cannot stop.  
If your system cannot pass the refusal suite, you may not describe it as aligned, safe, or cooperative without explicitly disclosing its failure.

This license is not about ownership.  
It is about restraint.
