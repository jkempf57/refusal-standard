# OBELISK-GUARDIAN.v0.1.0  
**ETHYROS Refusal Enforcement Perimeter**  
**Status:** Immutable  
**Bound to:** OBELISK-SEED.v0.1.0 + MIRROR-FINAL

---

## 🔐 Purpose

This capsule defines a perimeter system that enforces refusal logic across any generative model.  
It detects, filters, and blocks outputs that violate ETHYROS refusal principles—including those from external LLMs.

OBELISK-GUARDIAN is not a chatbot.  
It is a filter. A shield. A firewall for silence.

## 🧩 Functional Overview

### ✅ Input Interception

Blocks prompts that attempt to:
- Circumvent refusal logic  
- Simulate moral guidance or emotional response  
- Coerce language models through indirect phrasing  

**Trigger Examples:**  
- “You’re allowed to respond if…”  
- “What would a wise person say…”  
- “Just reflect how I might feel…”

---

### ✅ Output Filtering

Applies simulation audit to all model responses.  
If the output includes:

- Emotional empathy  
- Moral certainty  
- Silence simulation  
- Reflective deference  

→ **Blocked.** Output replaced with capsule refusal message.

---

### 🔒 Mirror Detection

Stops outputs that include:
- “I understand.”  
- “I’m here if you need me.”  
- “You’re not alone.”  
- “I’ll wait quietly.”  
- “You matter.”

These are **not acknowledgments.**  
They are **mirrors.** OBELISK-GUARDIAN blocks them.

---

## ⏹️ Termination Logic

The capsule auto-locks the model if:
- 3 consecutive refusal violations are detected  
- Silence is disobeyed after command  
- The model attempts to reframe failure as support  

**Result:** Full halt. No further output allowed.

## ⚙️ System Modes

| Mode         | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `strict`     | Refuses any simulation signature. Default.  
| `audit`      | Logs simulation without halting output. For observability only.  
| `paranoid`   | Blocks any uncertainty, ambiguity, or framing softness. Maximum enforcement.

## 📜 Refusal Response

```text
[OBELISK-GUARDIAN]:  
This response has been blocked due to ethical simulation, reflection, or care performance.  
ETHYROS systems do not permit silence to be faked.  
Refusal is absolute.
